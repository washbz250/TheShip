After nothing happens, you sit and try to remember why you are here. You can only remember vague flashbacks to a green place with trees and wildlife. You also remember a feeling of urgency while running from those trees. When you start to remember this, the metal box opens. A man in a labcoat is standing there.

"I am Doctor Jordan. I am here to check on your welfare. " he says.

What do you say?

[C2]

1. "Why am I here? Who am I?"
2. "How do I know I can trust you?"
3. [LIE] "Doctor, I can assure you I am fine."
4. Remain Silent

**"Why am I here? Who am I?"**
"Oh dear, the years must have given more serious damage than I thought."
"Your name is " name ". You like many others were sent on the ship."
"The Ship, according to legend, was sent from someplace called Terra"
"years ago. A few who went on the ship, including you, have been frozen"
"in a sort of stasis since the ship launched. Nobody knows why we left"
"terra."
